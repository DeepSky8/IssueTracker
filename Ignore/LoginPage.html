  How we do it
  </h3>
  <p>
  Using state-of-the-art tracking features, Issue Tracker keeps dedicated lists and integrated, detailed descriptions of issues in your database, so that we can track things together.

  Most importantly: Why we do it
  </h3>
  <h4 class="noTop">
  (and why you should too!)
  </h4>
  
  <p>
  We believe no issue should go untracked. If you are dealing with untracked issues, they will quickly pile up and overwhelm your business. Our dedicated tracking software and support staff make every business better.
